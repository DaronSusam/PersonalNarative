# Unit 4 - Personal Narrative

## Introduction

Images are often used to portray our personal experiences and interests. We also use image filters and effects to change or enhance the mood of an image. When combined into collages and presentations, these images tell a story about who we are and what is important to us. Your goal is to create a personal narrative using The Theater that consists of images of your personal experiences and/or interests, incorporates data related to these experiences and/or interests that can be organized in a 2D array, and uses image filters and effects to change or enhance the mood of your images.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, two-dimensional (2D) arrays, and algorithms to create your personal narrative collage or animation:

- **Create at least two 2D arrays** – Create at least two 2D arrays to store the data that will make up your visualization.
- **Implement one or more algorithms** – Implement one or more algorithms that use loops and two-way or multi-selection statements with compound Boolean expressions to analyze the data.
- **Use Image Filters** - Include multiple image filters learned from this unit, and additionally create new ones of your own.
- **Use methods in the String class** – Use one or more methods in the String class in your program, such as to determine whether the name of an image file contains specific characters.
- **Create a visualization** – Create an image or animation that conveys the story of the data by illustrating the patterns or relationships in the data.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.

## Story Description
My Story for the animation showcases my journey in my first two years in high school soccer. The story shows the levels of soccer I started and then how I moved myself up to a better place. I started off from watching the game on the bench of JV my freshman year to starting for Varsity the next year. After every sentence I put a picture after that correspond with the text. For example I put "Scoring on Var" and then put a picture of someone shooting the ball as if they are scoring. The data I used was my personal information from me and I put them into 2D arrays. This data is the backbone of my code and without it my project would be completly different.

## Image Filter Analysis
The filter I used in this project was my pixelate method. In this method the image I chose would pixelate in the theater. The method traverses each row of pixels by the gridSize amount (instead of by 1), then traverse each column of pixels by the gridSize amount (instead of by 1). Get the average red, green, and blue values of the pixels in that region, and set each red, green, and blue values in that region to the averages.
